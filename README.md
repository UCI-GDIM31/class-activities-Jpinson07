Hello World!

### W2
#1 r, g, and b are float variables because the color is determined by the decimal because that is the parameters that it was given that as the decimal increases the brightness increases or decreases. 
#2 The _bounce variable is an int because the bounce increases by a whole number since you can't get half a bounce so it increases only by a whole number. 
#3 It says error CS1002:; expected

1.The input would be the player's sanity level which would be a float variable. and the output would be void. 

1. A metaphor that compares them is Batman. Batman is a superhero who is known for his gadgets or his variables that help him function. He is the class himself and he holds the variables to commit actions. Batman is the class but he can become the component for the batmobile because without batman there is no functionality for the batmobile.

2. The balls get extremely bright if they bounce too many times because there is no limit and they will continue to get brighter until they turn white.

1.The solution I came up with for the collider activity is I added a rigidbody to the soccerball and cat because when adding rigidbody to both it allows them to interact with each other because they both are now able to interact with each other.I added is trigger to the goal so when the ball passes through it allows for a celebration.
2.My game did not work perfectly the first I tested it because the colliders were not interacting with each other because I put gravity on and the collider was too large so the cat was not interacting with the ball.
